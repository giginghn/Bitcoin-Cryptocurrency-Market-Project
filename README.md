# Bitcoin-Cryptocurrency-Market-Project
In this project on Datacamp, I want to better understand the growth and impact of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies by exploring the market capitalization of different cryptocurrencies.

Techniques used in this project:
1) Cleaning Data in Python
2) Manipulating DataFrames with pandas
